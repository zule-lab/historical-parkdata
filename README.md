Work in Progress

Repository dedicated to processing archival documents provided by City of Montr√©al archives. 


This repo contains the code and data for ongoing work. R scripts are organized in `script/`, archive pdfs `pdf/` (which is not tracked due to file size). Cleaned and converted docs can be found in `output`.

Package dependencies include: `tesseract`, `magick`, `pdftools`.
